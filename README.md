Hi there I have created the Authentication app using, react, next.js, jwt for auth and mongodb as database.
I made this app because I want to learn how authentication and routing works in next js and this is why i made this app.

So I have used mongodb to store the user's data and next js as a framework
Also I have used nodemailer and mailtrap  to get the tokens from email and I have used JWT and bcrypt for authentication .
